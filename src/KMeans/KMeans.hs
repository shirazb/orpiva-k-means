     {-
       First argument is list of (cluster index, point) pairs that have been
       ordered so that they appear in asecnding order of cluster index.

       Second argument is the index of the last cluster whose mean was being
       computed. This is always less than or equal to the cluster at the
       beginning of the list.

       Third argument is the number of points so far in this cluster.

       Fourth argument is the sum of the points in the cluster so far.

       Given an empty list, the returned value is the singleton list containing
       the mean of the current cluster (computed from the other arguments).

       Otherwise, there are two cases. The head of the list either refers to the
       current cluster, or we have traversed through all the points of the
       cluster and now the head refers to the next cluster.

       In the case where the current cluster's mean is still being computed,
       keep the index of the current cluster the same; add one to the number of
       points in this cluster; and add the current point to the sum so far.

       In the case where the head of the lists represents the start of the next
       cluster, compute the mean of the current cluster and recurse. The index
       of the current cluster is now the index found in the head of the list;
       the number of points in the cluster so far is one; and the sum of the
       cluster so far is simply the point at the head of the list.

       There is surely a much simpler design than this...
